			<h2>Covid-19 and the impact on schools</h2>
<time>Jul 30, 2020</time>

<p>Background: With September quickly approaching, many schools have released decisions and guidelines on reopening. The goal of this weekâ€™s discussion is to gain insights on the importance of an in-person education, our perspectives on the ramifications of education with coronavirus guidelines in place, and our insights for the impact coronavirus has had/will have on education.</p>

<p>Some relevant articles:
How schools are faring internationally after reopening, with many reporting an increase in infections as schools reopened - https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/school-openings-across-globe-suggest-ways-keep-coronavirus-bay-despite-outbreaks</p>

<p>McKinsey report quantifying the economic consequences of lost learning in the US, with estimated losses to GDP up to $480 billion - https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime</p>

<p>Do the consequences of staying at home outweigh the consequences of an in-person education? Being forced to stay at home has caused Italian children to develop unhealthy habits and lifestyles (see Economist_Unhealthy). Moreover, we see a damning effect in developing countries from Vietnam to India, especially on girls who are now forced into labor, abuse, and premature marriage with closed schools (see Economist_Girls).</p>
