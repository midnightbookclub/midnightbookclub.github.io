"Voter suppression is termed as the efforts, legal and illegal, used to prevent eligible voters from exercising their right to vote. Since the passage of women’s suffrage in 1920 and the voting rights act in 1965 (for minorities), on paper every American should be entitled to an equal vote. Yet voter suppression has since evolved to be more subtle, using methods like purging voter rolls (citing irrelevant reasons), disinformation campaigns, last-minute poll closures, etc. This has historically swung the course of countless elections at all levels, most recently the 2018 midterm elections. Stacey Abrams’ book “Our Time is Now” is a great resource on this topic, exploring voter suppression through the lens of her loss in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race. More recently the attention has been on mail-in ballots for the 2020 presidential election and the laws surrounding it. I think this week it would be cool to devote some time to recapping the different forms of voter suppression, its evolution over the years, and recent elections that it has influenced. More importantly, we could discuss its effect in the 2020 presidential election & how we can combat it."
