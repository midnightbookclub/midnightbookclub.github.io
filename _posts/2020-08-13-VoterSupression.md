## Summary

Voter suppression is termed as the efforts, legal and illegal, used to prevent eligible voters from exercising their right to vote. Since the passage of women’s suffrage in 1920 and the voting rights act in 1965 (for minorities), on paper every American should be entitled to an equal vote. Yet voter suppression has since evolved to be more subtle, using methods like purging voter rolls (citing irrelevant reasons), disinformation campaigns, last-minute poll closures, etc. This has historically swung the course of countless elections at all levels, most recently the 2018 midterm elections. Stacey Abrams’ book “Our Time is Now” is a great resource on this topic, exploring voter suppression through the lens of her loss in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race. More recently the attention has been on mail-in ballots for the 2020 presidential election and the laws surrounding it. I think this week it would be cool to devote some time to recapping the different forms of voter suppression, its evolution over the years, and recent elections that it has influenced.

Common forms
* Gerrymandering
* Census
    * redrawing congressional & state legislature district lines
    * mandatory citizenship questions (exclusionary to illegal immigrants) to allocate $$ accordingly in such districts
* Voter roll purges
* Strict voter ID laws (eg. Texas)
* Felony disenfranchisement (eg. California)
* Faulty equipment/intimidation at polling booths
* More recently:
    * Mail in ballot/absentee ballot slander by current administration
    * Defunding USPS to support the above

Key Takeaway: Voter suppression doesn’t always involve the actual execution of the above methods. Of equal or higher impact is the impending threat of the above methods being executed, which leads **to lower political efficacy in our voting system, thereby discouraging eligible voters from showing up at the polls**. Our government relies on low voter turnout.


## Argument for fighting voter suppression 

A fundamental right isn’t just doing the bare minimum to maintain the status quo. It means fighting to champion it, especially when it is under attack.

**Cornerstone Cases**

NC Law struck down by SC targeting African American voters
"That fight began in 2013, when the state made cuts to early voting, created a photo ID requirement and eliminated same-day registration, out-of-precinct voting and preregistration of high school students.”
"More than half of all voters there use early voting, and African-Americans do so at higher rates than whites. African-Americans also tend to overwhelmingly vote for Democrats."

Photo ID:
Thirty-six states have identification requirements at the polls. Seven states have strict photo ID laws, under which voters must present one of a limited set of forms of government-issued photo ID in order to cast a regular ballot – no exceptions. Voter ID laws have been estimated by the U.S. Government Accountability Office to reduce voter turnout by 2-3 percentage points, translating to tens of thousands of votes lost in a single state.
Over 21 million U.S. citizens do not have government-issued photo identification.
College students are unfairly targeted by this -- as many of them are out of state & do not have govt. issued ID despite being highly engaged & eligible voters.

Voter fraud is a common reason used to justify voter suppression techniques, but numerous studies have shown that the %ge of fraudulent votes is marginal compared to the resources/media attention allocated to it.

On average, Black voters wait 45% longer to vote than white voters, and Latinx voters wait 46% longer.

Police violence, healthcare inequality, affordable housing, and the school-to-prison pipeline are all issues that start at the local level and can be influenced by voting. Makes sense that politicians want to keep these structures in place

COVID-19 is being used as an excuse to close polling places, one of the most blatant forms of suppression. During this year’s primaries, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Kentucky experienced shutdowns that led to limited access to voting and overcrowding. 

Unfortunately, this is still a debate because Current suppression tactics all have historic precedent. “A poll tax now looks like a polling location closing, a literacy test is now a signature match. It’s the same desire to suppress voters of color, but they just do it in different ways.” 

Voter suppression is political tradition. “From the very founding of our nation, voting has been something that is exclusive,” she said. “There has always been a very well-funded, focused effort to suppress the right to vote.”

It causes a generational problem, both in terms of public sentiment of specific groups towards voting, and census which has a 10 yr effect. Trump signed that citizenship is not a valid question for 2020 census dafuq??

## Archaic historic reasons

More for convenience than anything else, most states hold their general elections to sync with the federal election date of the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. That date was set in legislation in 1845 to make sure that in an agrarian society, people could travel to vote and be back home both for Market Day and for the Sabbath. It has not been changed to conform to modern times-- for 175 years!

**Democrats for voter suppression**

Why do Democrats and Democratic-aligned groups prefer off-cycle elections? When school boards and other municipal offices are up for election at odd times, few run-of-the-mill voters show up at the polls, but voters with a particular interest in these elections — like city workers themselves — show up in full force. The low-turnout election allows their policy goals to dominate.

Anzia shows that off-cycle elections lead to higher salaries and better health and retirement benefits for teachers and public employees. Anzia studies these effects in many different ways. The simplest way is by looking at eight states that allow local governments to set their own election dates. She compares school districts that hold school board elections on-cycle and off-cycle within the same state. Controlling for factors that might make districts different from one another — like their population size, income, racial composition, partisan leanings and how urban or rural they are — Anzia found that the maximum base teacher salary is over 4 percent higher in districts with off-cycle elections.


## Only arguments for voter suppression:

A National holiday expensive. I think it's self explanatory -- arguments based solely on the economic impact 

Mail-in ballots vs absentee ballots

Absentee ballot - those who are unable to be physically present to vote (being outside the country, being in prison but still able to vote, having religious beliefs that prevent then for going to a voting center, working on being on jury duty during polling hours, or serving as an election worker or poll watcher). has an application process.
Mail-in - Umbrella term for absentee ballots + all-mail voting in certain states (Registered voters in Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington automatically receive a mail ballot before Election Day and the ballot is then mailed back or deposited a voting location on Election Day). same as a “no excuse required absentee ballot” -> no application required -> but same verification process (everything is sealed & certified) & can still be persecuted for fraudulent voting
A study by Stanford University found that mail-in voting does not favor the voting turnout for either major political party. The study also found that mail-in voting increased voter turnout by around 2%.
Trump: he actually mail-in voted since FL doesn’t have an absentee system in place. It more closely resembles “no excuse” absentee ballot.

The coronavirus relief bill included $400 million for states to allow them to expand mail-in or early voting. The Brennan Center for Justice estimated that it would cost $982 million to $1.4 billion on top of what states are spending now to ensure a vote-by-mail option is available to all voters in November.

Autonomy
Federal government imposes pretty loose restrictions on elections. State governments are given a lot of leeway in terms of implementation details including polling booth technology, how information is presented on the ballot, and execution is done by local civil servants.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is the independent regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing the federal campaign finance law. The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S. House, Senate, Presidency and the Vice Presidency. How bout the same for elections


**Landmark Legislation - Pro**

Help America Vote Act (2002) - after Bush v Gore in 2000

The Democratic-majority U.S. House has passed several measures, including 2019’s H.R. 1, or the For the People Act, which expands voting rights, limits partisan gerrymandering, and strengthens ethical rules. But, it’s being held up in the U.S. Senate — specifically right-wing Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell — which means it can’t go into effect.

What we can do even without legislation
Get informed  — about the ballot, physical polling booth location near u, and the mail-in/absentee ballot laws in your state (esp. republican states)
Prepare — have your own PPE ready, have multiple active state-issued photo IDs on hand
Volunteer time & donate $$ to orgs/NGOs fighting for this
ACLU: No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we’ve filed 14 lawsuits and counting to ensure every eligible voter can vote by mail. With your support, we’ll keep fighting to protect the safety and rights of all voters.

**The Utopian Future according to Stacy Abrams**

Giving people the opportunity to vote in the way that’s most effective for them
vote by mail - ballot sent to you automatically by virtue of your citizenship/eligibility, postage paid
booklet sent that explains what the ballot means, who’s on it
should you choose to vote in person, instructions on what to do
should be able to vote as much as 15 days early at the polling booth
abundant & proximal voting booths with minimal wait times
polling volunteers to aid with disabilities, language barriers, etc.
national holiday on Election Day

## Questions
* What do you think the ideal future for free & fair elections should look like?
* What are the biggest ways to combat this problem specifically in the 2020 presidential election?
    * Attacks: verbal against mail-in ballots, blocking USPS funding, not enough stimulus $$ towards absentee ballots
* Privatizing elections?
    * Federal elections are administered by state and local governments, although the specifics of how elections are conducted differ between the states. The Constitution and laws of the United States grant the states wide latitude in how they administer elections — conflict of interest
