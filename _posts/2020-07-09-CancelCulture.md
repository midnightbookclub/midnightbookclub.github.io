## What is cancel culture?
* To ‘cancel’ or remove support/punish people or companies after an offensive gesture
* A movement where people were ‘canceled’ (removed from jobs/ socially held accountable) most commonly in the form of social media

## Examples of cancel culture
* CEO being forced to resign after racial derogatory comments
* Woman being ‘canceled’ after yelling at a black male for BLM graffiti
* Woman being ‘canceled’ after traffic white with a black male

## Does cancel culture have any benefit?
* People are being held accountable by society
    * System is created where people face consequences for socially unacceptable behavior
* People are more aware of their actions
    * Heightened sense of checking their behavior so ‘cancelation’ will not occur
    * Companies have to be more accountable
        * Better HR policies

## Does cancel culture have any consequences?
* Breeds a culture of fear
    * People are afraid to disagree and express their opinions in case they are ‘canceled’
        * Curtails growth and does not allow for open discussion
        * Creates echo chamber for opinions
* Consequences of being ‘canceled’ can be dire
    * People lose jobs and livelihood over ‘cancelation’ where it may not necessarily be justified
    * Creates an environment of bullying
* Corporate and social cause division is blurred
    * Companies can be forced to side one way or other when other employees may be in disagreement

## What is the appropriate level of being ‘canceled’?
* Does the punishment fit the crime?
    * People have different opinions depending on nature of crimes
        * Women lost her job and bullied may not have needed to be the outcome to inspire change
    * Some crimes are met with general agreement
        * Bill Cosby and sexual assault- deserves to be canceled

## Who decides how much a person should be ‘canceled’?
* Should justice be left to judicial court system?
    * Yes position: court is more objective, less fueled by emotion, less ‘mob’ mentality, too lenient for big crines
    * No position: big change has not come necessarily from court rulings and more extreme action is necessary
* Should society be the one to enact this power?
    * Yes position: creates more personal consequences
    * No position: public shaming, less freedom, can often be too extreme 

## What actions should lead to ‘cancelation’?
* Racial, sexual assault, overarching big ‘NO’ deeds
* Should politics matter?
    * Different viewpoints should not be penalized but inherent fear to be wrong by societal standards can exist in sub context

		* Liberal, conservative big divide
	* Fear/panic of coronavirus
